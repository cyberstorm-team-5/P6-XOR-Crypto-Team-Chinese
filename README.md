## About
This repository contains the code and other resources used for the sixth programming assignment, XOR Crypto. The Python code will implement the XOR Crypto method by reading a key from a file named "key" in the current directory, along with the plaintext or ciphertext from stdin, and sending the resulting plaintext or ciphertext to stdout.
